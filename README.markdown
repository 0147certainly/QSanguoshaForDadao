Open Source Sanguosha
==========

Introduction
----------

Sanguosha is both a popular board game and online game,
this project try to clone the Sanguosha online version.
The whole project is written in C++, 
using Qt's graphics view framework as the game engine.
I've tried many other open source game engines, 
such as SDL, HGE, Clanlib and others, 
but many of them lacks some important features. 
Although Qt is an application framework instead of a game engine, 
but its graphics view framework is suitable for my game developing.

Features
----------

Most of them are in unfinished status.

1. Framework
    * Open source with Qt graphics view framework
    * Easy to add user-defined generals and cards

2. Operation experience
    * Drag card to target to use card
    * Use mouse's right button to drag card to use general's skill
    * Keyboard shortcut
    * Cards sorting (by card type and card suit)
    * Voice control (just experimental, very unstable)
